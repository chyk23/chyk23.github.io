This is the source code to the website for my final year project. 

The website can be accessed from https://chyk23.github.io

To run the website locally, the source code must be hosted on a local server for assets like bootstrap and three.js to work.
For example, using Virtual Studio Code, using the Live Server extension, click to view the website with Live Server and it should open the page on your browser using localhost.
